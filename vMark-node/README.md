<h1 align="center"># Overview</h1>

<p align="center">vMark-node is a software-based open-source Ethernet demarcation NID designed for flexibility and democratization in the Carrier industry.</p>

<p align="center">The "-node"** refers to this being the client-side of <a href="https://github.com/xmas-ar/vMark">vMark</a> server. (vMark-node doenst need vMark to work). </p>

<h1 align="center"># Architecture</h1>

**Shell**:
Provides command-line auto-completion, some help-related features and dynamically builds the command tree based on the modules and installed plugins. This enables a modular, scalable and re-usable interactive CLI experience.

**Dispatcher**:
Interprets user commands, determines the appropriate module to handle each command, and routes execution accordingly. The dispatcher acts as the central coordinator between the shell and the available modules/plugins, Web-UI and API interactions talk directly with the Dispatcher.

**Modules**:
Shell modules encapsulate core command logic and define the command tree structure. Examples: 'show', 'config', and 'system', each representing a set of related commands and subcommands with item descriptions.

**Plugins**:
Integrate external libraries or tools to extend functionality. For example, plugins can provide access to third-party systems such as OpenBFDD, allowing seamless integration with external services.
